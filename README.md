# Bonsai Pricing Page Replica


üå± This project aims to replicate the pricing page of Bonsai, a software company, to gain experience with Toggle Switches, Accordions, and Dropdown menus. The goal is to understand how these UI components work and interact with JavaScript. Although the landing page has been completed, ongoing maintenance is being performed to fix bugs and make it a complete clone of Bonsai's pricing page.

## üßó Challenges Faced
Creating this project presented several challenges, especially for a first-time endeavor with Toggle Switches, Accordions, and Dropdowns, as well as implementing JavaScript interactivity. The pricing layout required careful structuring, and making the page responsive was also a significant hurdle. Thankfully, I was able to overcome these challenges with the support of online resources and problem-solving skills.
