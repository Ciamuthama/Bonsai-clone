# Bonsai Pricing Page Replica


üå± This project aims to replicate the pricing page of Bonsai, a software company, to gain experience with Toggle Switches, Accordions, and Dropdown menus. The goal is to understand how these UI components work and interact with JavaScript. Although the landing page has been completed, ongoing maintenance is being performed to fix bugs and make it a complete clone of Bonsai's pricing page.
